Yerevan for me is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. 

<!-- more -->

But did you know that Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world? The city was founded in 782 BC and is more then 2800 years old. In comparison the historical city of Rome was founded only 30 years later.

On 1st August I arrived in Yerevan for the first time. But the city wasn't the reason I travelled to Armenia.
Lil showed me around and I had the chance to see and feel one of the most beautiful cities I've been (and this although COVID-19 was full on). 

Yerevan is a beautiful city, rich in history and culture. 

It has the beautiful nickname 'Pink City' and that is because the pink buildings in this city. The marjoriy can be found around the Republic Square. The color comes from lava stones that was formed from volcanic ash.

The city is very pedestrian friendly, you can basically tour the entire city by foot. Lil and I had quite many walks all around the city, once from the Genocide museum back to our apartment, which was more then 12 km of walking (one-way though!). A walking tour is the best way to really get immersed in Yerevan’s culture, history and cuisine. The city centre is, of course, the place to do this, as it is home to landmarks like the grand Republic Square, the impressive Opera House and the famous Cascade complex.

Walking around the city centre is a phenomenal way to see the history of the city, from the Persian times to the Soviet periods. You will also get a glimpse at Yerevan’s modern side, with contemporary architecture, coffee shops and trendy restaurants being found along the alleyways and the main streets. The city is literally full of cafes! Every park, every square, especially the Republic Square, most of the streets have them. And the coffee here is **exceptional**. And those cafes are the perfect place to work as almost all of the offer excellent free wifi. We spent a couply of days sitting in a cafe working for hours. This were the perfect working days, I liked them a lot.

One of my favorite places is the Republic Square. This is the palace where the 2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution took place. In the evenings you can watch the singing fountain show. It usually starts around 9 p.m. and goes until around 11 p.m. Just around the corner, are my two favorite places - the best breakfast in town you'll find in [Baguette & Co](https://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g293932-d8433876-Reviews-Baguette_Co-Yerevan.html). One of our favorites, and actually a place I couldn't wait to have dinner at even before I arrived in Yerevan is [The Italian](https://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g293932-d10438453-Reviews-The_Italian_Armenia-Yerevan.html).

The Cascade complex is a massive staircase with fountains, which was built to connect the northern and central parts of Yerevan. There are 572 steps leading to the top of the Cascade. Inside the complex, the have the Cafesijian Museum of Art, which unfortunately due to the pandemic I wasn't able to visit. Hope we can soon.

#### I love the local cuisine
The local cuisine is rich in meat, vegatables and free herbs. Especially eggplant and lavash, the traditional Armenian bread, are widely used. I personally like the Armenian cuisine a lot, mostly because of the great, fresh and real products that they use. My all-time favorite is Lil's Dolma (ground meat rolled in grape leaves).

Armenia is one of the oldest wine-producing regions of the world. And they do have a great wines, my favorite is TUS, a dry white wine from the Tavush region. For me one of the best white dry wines I've ever had.

Unfortunatelly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic I was not able to see as much as I wanted to. But I will...Stay tuned, more to come.
