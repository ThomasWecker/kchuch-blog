Hidden in a verdant valley 13km northeast of Dilijan, Haghartsin ('Dance of the Eagles’) was built between the 10th and 13th centuries and has three churches: one named for Gregory the Illuminator; another for the Virgin Mary (Surp Astvatsatsin); and the third for St Stephen (Stepanos). There are stunning khachkars (carved stone crosses; don't miss the one on the southern wall of Surp Astvatsatsin), a sundial on the wall of St Gregory, a ruined gavit (antechamber) and a refectory with a stunning arched ceiling.

The monastery was built by order of two brothers, princes of the Bagratuni kingdom, and their family seal can be seen on the back of St Stepanos.

The most ancient structure of Haghartsin complex is St. Gregory church. It was constructed in the 11th century by monks who escaped prosecutions from Western Armenia which was subject to Byzantium . The rectangular church is rather small. Internal space is cross-shaped. The church is crowned with cone-shaped dome on octahedral drum. In the end of the 12th century a small churchlet from blue basalt with vaulted arches and the room for prayers and burials was added to it.

In 1244 the small churchlet of St. Stepanos, a tiny copy of the main church of St. Gregory was constructed.

The refectory is a rare example of architecture. It was erected by architect Minas in 1248. The room is divided into two square parts covered with the system of crisscrossed arches. Along the wall there pass stone benches; in the western end, near the door is a wide arched doorway for numerous pilgrims.

In the 13th century the monastery became the major centre of spiritual and cultural life of Armenia. Near the refectory there are the ruins of kitchen; near the monastery the remains of several chapels can be seen. Near the southern wall of St. Gregory church there are the ruins of two tombs of Kyurikid dynasty tsars with the inscriptions: "Tsar Smbat" and “It is the tomb of tsar Gagik” (10 – 11th centuries).
