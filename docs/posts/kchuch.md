Kchuch in Armenian means clay pot, which means that the restaurant prepares everything in clay pots in traditional red brick ovens.

I loved this place since I've seen the menu. The ingredients and cooking process were described in a really creative way, something like "We have used the matsun (yougurt) of uncle Misha's sheeps or honey of Gohar's bees." I don't know if menu in English is like that, but in Armenian it was super creative and funny.
And food was really delicious and also creative. Kchuch's stuff created unique pizzas and other dishes which one cannot eat in other places. Mushrooms, vegetables, BBQ anf everything else I've tried were amazing. In addition to this, they use homemade ingredients promoting local small bussinesses.
Also, the stuff was very friendly, the waiter answered every question about food and made suggestions. the The manager was asking every visitor whether they liked the food and how they feel. And when she noticed that we couldn't finish our lahmacuns, she offered us to take it away.
I definetely will visit Kchuch when I'll come to Dilijan again.
