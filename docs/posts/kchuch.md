Kchuch in Armenian means clay pot, which means that the restaurant prepares everything in clay pots in traditional red brick ovens.

I loved this place since since I've been there with Lil for the first time. [kchuch Dilijan](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1160895-d10518721-r408547125-Kchuch_Restaurant-Dilijan_Tavush_Province.html).
One of the best restaurants in Armenia, Kchuch is located in the middle of a lush park in the heart of Dilijan. Most of the food is baked inside brick ovens in a kchuch. They also offer a lovely self-made wine.

But what does all this have to do with the name of the blog? Stay tuned to find out...
