We had the idea for this blog during the COVID-19 lockdown. We were planning my trivp to Yerevan, thinking about things we could do or what new things we could learn while being locked at home.

kchuch.me is a our personal blog dedicated to our journey together, places we have been or want to go, thoughts, books, culture, history or anything else that drives us. For you as visitor this is a place that looks for perspective to make most of the life you are walking through.

Thank you for being here and following along on our journey.
