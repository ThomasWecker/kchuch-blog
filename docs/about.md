We had the idea for this blog during the COVID-19 lockdown, thinking about things we could do while being locked at home.
kchuch.me is a our personal blog dedicated to our life as two hearts that found each other. Btw. the name kchuch means clay pot in Armenian. If you want to know more how this site got it's name, [click here](posts/kchuch.html).

As we both are interested in a vast of topics and like very much travelling this site features stories about beautiful travel destinations, places we both love, hapiness, culture, things that make us think and a lot more. 

Thank you for being here and following along on our journey.
